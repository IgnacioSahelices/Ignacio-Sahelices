**Portfolio Project**
This repository houses my personal portfolio, a testament to my journey in web development. Built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases my proficiency in these fundamental technologies.

Although I am well-versed with React, I deliberately chose to craft this portfolio using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The aim was to validate and reinforce my understanding of the basic building blocks of web development.

The process of creating this portfolio was both challenging and rewarding. The design is original, born from my own creativity. This meant multiple iterations and adaptations to ensure the final output was both aesthetically pleasing and functionally sound.

Despite the hurdles faced during the development process, the experience and knowledge gained made it all worthwhile. Each step, each roadblock, each solution brought its own lessons, contributing significantly to my growth as a developer.

Feel free to explore the code to get an understanding of my coding style and practices. Feedback is always welcome as I am on a continuous journey of learning and improvement.
